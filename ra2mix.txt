MIX Files
Inside ra2.mix you can find more .mix archives. The files are sorted by the .mix archive they are located in.

cache.mix
bombcurs.shp
RA2-Bombcurs.png
An unused bomb icon, similar to the Ivan bomb icon but with a different palette and the last frame appears with a skull. The last frame was to be used with remotely-detonatable Ivan bombs, but these were scrapped.

wrench.shp
RA2-Wrench.png
Similar to the final version, but with a different palette.
C&C-RA2-wrench.gif

Tiberian Sun Leftovers
As mentioned above, the respective palettes cannot be found in the Red Alert 2 files. The files in most cases use the animation palettes from Tiberian Sun, which appears to have been used for Red Alert 2's animations during development before switching to a unique palette.

curtcurs.shp
RA2-Curtcurs.png

Early cursor for the Iron Curtain.

dropdown.shp
RA2-Dropdown.png
Leftover interface graphics from Tiberian Sun's abandoned "Dropshop Loadout" feature.

dropup.shp
RA2-Dropup.png
Leftover interface graphics from Tiberian Sun's abandoned "Dropshop Loadout" feature.

poweroff.shp
RA2-Poweroff.png
Leftover graphic from Tiberian Sun. This would be overlaid on any buildings whose power had been deactivated. Presumably abandoned in Red Alert 2 whenever the ability to individually control building power was abandoned.
C&C-RA2-poweroff.gif

conquer.mix
bbblelrg.shp
RA2-Bbblelrg.png
"Large" Bubbles, possibly for swimming units like Tanya or the SEAL, maybe even the Sub. Missing palette data.

beacon.shp
RA2-Beacon.png
Dropship beacon animation from Tiberian Sun. Uses a Tiberian Sun palette.
C&C-RA2-beacon.gif

bomb.shp
RA2-Bomb.png
An unused projectile graphic from Tiberian Sun, where it also went unused.
C&C-RA2-bomb.gif

buildngz.shp
RA2-Buildngz.png
Never shown in-game, but is used to control how buildings display and overlap with each other. Supports buildings up to 396x477 pixels in size.

chemisle.shp
RA2-Chemisle.png
Was used in the bonus crates in Tiberian Sun, where the earned premium would be a one-use Chemical Missile. Uses the Tiberian Sun animation palette.
C&C-RA2-chemisle.gif

chronobm.shp
RA2-Chronobm.png
Part of the original animation for the Chrono Sphere super weapon. This would have been tiled from the top of the screen and played with the exit vortex, but was later abandoned. Uses Tiberian Sun's animation palette, supporting the idea that Red Alert 2's animations were originally created in this palette before development of a unique colour set.
C&C-RA2-chronobm.gif

chronodb.shp
RA2-Chronodb.png

chronofs.shp
RA2-Chronofs.png

chronosb.shp
RA2-Chronosb.png
Original and crude graphic for the Chrono Sphere super weapon. Most likely placeholders. Uses Tiberian Sun's animation palette.

cleg.shp
The chrono-legionnaire has a paradrop frame despite never being paradropped.

C&C-RA2-cleg 0116.png

cloak.shp
RA2-Cloak.png
Can be activated in rules.ini, and is obtained through bonus crates. It gives invisibility for any unit that touches the box. This was a crate feature from Tiberian Sun, where this animation was used, but the crate was presumably disabled in Red Alert 2 as "cloak" logic was adapted for underwater units (cloaked units will make the "sub appearing" sound rather than a (de)cloaking noise). Uses Tiberian Sun's animation palette.
C&C-RA2-cloak.gif

dbrs10sm.shp
RA2-Dbrs10sm.png
An unused debris animation, presumably representing an "ejected" human body.

rock.shp
Rocketeers have multiple unused animations. An alternate air death animation isn't used due to how rocketeers are programmed. A cheer animation only plays while they're on the ground, which only happens in "Mirage". Two ground death animations exist while due to the mechanics of rocketeers they immediately explode while dying on the ground. Rocketeers also have animations for being prone, which don't play due to being fearless.

gggate_b.shp / gggatezb.shp
Leftover gate sprites from Tiberian Sun. Frames for every animation exist and the sprites have been stretched up slightly to accommodate Red Alert 2's slightly larger isometric grid. Still rendered in Tiberian Sun's unit palette.

ggspot.shp / ggspotmk.shp
RA2Ggspot.png
Unused tower sprites from Tiberian Sun. Like the above, frames for every animation exist and the sprites were stretched up slightly. These were also rendered in Tiberian Sun's unit palette, which differs from Red Alert 2's only by the inclusion of a few extra colours - these appear as solid magenta in Red Alert 2's palette, as seen on the side of this tower sprite.

ngcnstdm.shp
RA2Ngcnstdm.png
Unused destruction animation for the Soviet Construction Yard. The Construction Yard design is mirrored from that used in the final game, but resembles that used on the rear of the Red Alert 2 box art, indicating a leftover pre-release graphic.

Unused loading screens using a Tiberian Sun palette. There are three resolutions available, and two identical loading screens per resolution per faction.

These are all veteran icons that are programmed to appear when a spy infiltrates an enemy production building, allowing the player to directly construct veteran units. However, these units are unable to actually be promoted in the course of normal gameplay, and so the icons are never seen - the dogs are purposely set to not gain experience levels; Ivans cannot gain experience due to the programming quirks of their weapon; and both the MCVs and the Spy do not have any weaponry to allow them to even gain experience. In any case, the icons look unfinished, given the size of the text compared to the finished game's icons, and the Crazy Ivan veteran icon uses a different image to the vanilla icon.

RA2-Xxicon.png
This icon is used as a placeholder for units which do not have their own build icon, such as civilian props and mission-specific special units. It is never seen in the course of normal gameplay, unless playing on a custom map which allows the construction of these civilian or unbuildable units.

C&C-RA2-YuriEngineerCameo.pngC&C-RA2-YuriEngineerVetCameo.png

C&C-RA2-MiGCameo.png
MiGs have their own cameo that goes unused as they're not buildable and only obtainable from Boris' airstrike.

C&C-RA2-CosmonautVetCameo.png
The cosmonaut's veteran icon goes unused as there are no allied players in the one level where it's available, the cameo also displays an old name for it.

C&C-RA2-ConYardCameo.pngC&C-RA2-ChronoPrisonCameo.png
Placeholder cameos for the construction yard and the chrono prison, a cut concept.

There are other unused cameos using the Tiberian Sun model used for cameo. You can see some icons early in the RA2 for GAP generator, Dolphin, Constructyard, an early version of conscript, a Soviet helicopter "Apache" which is unused and a Tesla Coil. Other cameos were used in Tiberian Sun.
